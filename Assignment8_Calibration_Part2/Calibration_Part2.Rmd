```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(sensitivity)

msage = readRDS(here("data/msage.RDS"))

msagel = msage %>% gather(key="run",value="str", -date, -month, -day, -year, -wy,-obs)

source(here("R/combined_rmse.R"))
compute_all_metrics
```

### Using your performance metric that you developed in Calibration Part 1

#### Use the performance values as weights to come up with a max likelihood estimate (MLE) of

a)  daily streamflow
b)  another component of streamflow that is relevant given your performance metric (e.g August streamflow in the class example)

#### Graph MLE and observed for the streamflow component of interest

#### Compute the correlations between observed and the MLE and observed flow for daily flow and your streamflow component of interest
