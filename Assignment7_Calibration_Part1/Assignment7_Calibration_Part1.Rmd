```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

msage = readRDS(here("data/msage.RDS"))
#View(msage)

# first rearrange so we can plot all results
msagel = msage %>% gather(key="run",value="str", -date, -month, -day, -year, -wy,-obs)

#### Develop another metric of performance (different from in-class example)




#### Apply to all runs in the dataset




#### Find the "best" parameter set based on your metric




#### Decide on a threshold for acceptability:

*plot results for all acceptable parameters* and *choose a plot that shows model performance in a way that fits your metric*
