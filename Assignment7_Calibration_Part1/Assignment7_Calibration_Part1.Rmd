# Assignment 7: Calibration Part 1

### 2025-06-04

#### Develop another metric of performance (different from in-class example)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(sensitivity)

msage = readRDS(here("data/msage.RDS"))

msagel = msage %>% gather(key="run",value="str", -date, -month, -day, -year, -wy,-obs)

source(here("R/combined_rmse.R"))
compute_all_metrics
```

#### Apply to all runs in the dataset

```{r}
# Apply compute_all_metrics() to each run and extract each metric from the returned list
results <- msagel %>%
  group_by(run) %>%
  summarise(
    combined_metric = compute_all_metrics(str, obs, month)$combined_metric,
    rmse_normal = compute_all_metrics(str, obs, month)$rmse_normal,
    cor = compute_all_metrics(str, obs, month)$cor
  )
```


#### Find the "best" parameter set based on your metric

```{r}
# Find the run with the highest combined metric
# use max because high correlation and low RMSE is good
best_run <- results %>%
  filter(combined_metric == max(combined_metric, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(run, combined_metric)

print(best_run)
```


#### Decide on a threshold for acceptability
```{r}
# Define a threshold for acceptability based on the combined metric
quantile(results$combined_metric, 0.9)

threshold <- 0.71
acceptable_runs <- results %>%
  filter(combined_metric >= threshold)
print(acceptable_runs)
```

*plot results for all acceptable parameters* and *choose a plot that shows model performance in a way that fits your metric*

```{r}
# Plot the results for all acceptable runs
ggplot(acceptable_runs, aes(x = run, y = combined_metric)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Acceptable Runs Based on Combined Metric",
       x = "Run",
       y = "Combined Metric") +
  theme_minimal()


#Chose scatter plot to show model perforamnce in a way that fits my metric
ggplot(results, aes(x = rmse_normal, y = cor, color = combined_metric)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "C", direction = 1) +
  labs(title = "Model Performance: Correlation vs Normalized RMSE",
       x = "Normalized RMSE (lower is better)",
       y = "Correlation (higher is better)",
       color = "Combined Metric") +
  theme_minimal()
```
