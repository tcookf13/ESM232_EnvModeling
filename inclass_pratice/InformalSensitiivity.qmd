Run Solar Model with Data

```{r solar}

source(here("R/solarpv.R"))
solarpv

# read in R formatted data
load(here("data/sierraczosolar.rda"))

sierraczosolar <- sierraczosolar %>% subset(year > 1944 & year < 1954)


# run the model
solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", eunit = "W")

# run and save results - but don't plot
site1 <- solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", eunit = "W", g = FALSE)
site1$mean
site1$annual

# consider a different pv array that only uses
# diffuse and has non standard efficiency (0.6)
site2 <- solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", eunit = "W", g = FALSE, eff = 0.6, etype = "direct")
site2$mean

Informal Sensitivity Analysis

```{r sen1, eval=T}
# lets try informal sensitivity analysis again, this time by varying efficiency if we don't know efficiency exactly , lets try 20 samples

# use map from purrr
# notice how map adds the one parameter that is missing from the input list
eff <- rnorm(mean = 0.6, sd = 0.1, n = 20)
site2 <- eff %>% map(~ solarpv(area = 0.1, solar = sierraczosolar, clr = "green", eunit = "W", g = FALSE, etype = "direct", eff = .x))

head(site2)

# this is pretty messy - but we can extract a useful data structure,lets say we want
# just the annual data (not the mean annual time series), and then reformat as a data frame with nice column names
tmp <- map_df(site2, `[`, c("annual"))

site2df <- data.frame(year = tmp$annual$year, elect = tmp$annual$elect)

# now we could plot
ggplot(site2df, aes(year, elect, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Electricity generated in W")

# we also might want an average across parameter uncertainty
site2_average <- site2df %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(elect = mean(elect))

# now add this to the plot - note that we remove the grouping by using group=1
ggplot(site2df, aes(year, elect, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Electricity in W") +
  geom_line(data = site2_average, aes(year, elect, group = 1), col = "orange")

# we could also plot how the mean annual electricity varies with efficiency (eff from above)
site2[[1]]

tmp <- map_df(site2, `[`, c("mean"))

# how variable is electricity generation (mean over all time) with uncertainty in solar efficiency

site2_mean <- data.frame(eff = eff, elect = tmp)
ggplot(site2_mean, aes(y = mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Electricity in W")

# or to see what the sensitivity looks like
ggplot(site2_mean, aes(eff, mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Electricity in W", x = "Solar Efficiency")
