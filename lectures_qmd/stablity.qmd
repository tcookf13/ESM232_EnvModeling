Example of exploring stability with our proportional harvest model

```{r stability2}
source("../R/dharvest.R")
dharvest

# given some forest characteristics - lets look at derivatives under different harvest rates
lowHrate <- 0.015
gps <- list(harv = lowHrate, K = 100, r = 0.05)

# look at the derivative over a range of forest sizes

findstable <- data.frame(Ccurr = seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 5))
# notice use of Time=NULL, and map to compute derivative
# for different values of forest biomass
findstable$dervHlow <- unlist(findstable$Ccurr %>% map(~ dharvest(parms = gps, Time = NULL, P = .x)))

ggplot(findstable, aes(Ccurr, dervHlow)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "red") +
  labs(y = "Derivative\n (Rate of change of forest carbon) (kg/C/year)", x = "Current Forest Carbon Stock (kgC)")

# Populations will be stable when derivative is zero!

# look at a different harvest rate
midHrate <- 0.02
gps <- list(harv = midHrate, K = 100, r = 0.05)
findstable$dervHmid <- unlist(findstable$Ccurr %>% map(~ dharvest(parms = gps, Time = NULL, P = .x)))

# try high rate
highHrate <- 0.05
gps <- list(harv = highHrate, K = 100, r = 0.05)
findstable$dervHhigh <- unlist(findstable$Ccurr %>% map(~ dharvest(parms = gps, Time = NULL, P = .x)))


# plot them all together
tmp <- gather(findstable, key = "HarvestRate", value = "value", -Ccurr)
ggplot(tmp, aes(Ccurr, value, color = HarvestRate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "black") +
  labs(x = "Forest Biomass (kgC)", y = "Forest Growth Rate (kgC/year)")

# notice how with higher harvest rates the stable population will be lower
```
